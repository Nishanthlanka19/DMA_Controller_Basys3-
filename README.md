# DMA_Controller_Basys3-
The purpose of this project is to understand the operation of a basic DMA controller and its interaction with memory and peripheral systems. The DMA controller facilitates high-speed data transfers between memory and peripherals without CPU intervention, reducing latency and computational overhead.
